    <p>
      I'm a software engineer and technical writer living in the Bay Area. Currently, I work as a software engineer for <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a>.

    <p>
      This site will be a place where I hope to clarify my thinking about things
      I'm learning, and perhaps a couple pages showing stuff I'm working on.
      The latest cool thing I learned was how to reimplement
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute">traceroute</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also
      <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/71603522-joseph-lipper?shelf=read">
        read books from time to time</a>. The last good book I read was
      <span class="italic">The Wanderers</span> by Meg Howrey.
